# Question of the Day API

The **Question of the Day API** is a RESTful service built with C# and ASP.NET Core.  
It allows users to:

- **Submit questions** via a `POST` endpoint
- **Retrieve the daily question** via a `GET` endpoint  
The API serves **one random question per day**, ensuring consistency throughout a 24-hour period.

## Features

- RESTful API architecture
- Data persistence with **PostgreSQL** (via Entity Framework Core)
- Auto-generated documentation with **Swagger**
- Daily question logic with random selection & date tracking
- SQLite support in development
